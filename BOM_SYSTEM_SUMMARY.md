# BOM System - Odoo-Style Implementation

## Overview
The BOM (Bill of Materials) system has been enhanced to work exactly like Odoo's manufacturing module, with automatic cost calculation, real-time production capacity analysis, and inventory integration.

## Key Features

### 1. **Odoo-Style BOM Creation**
Just like in Odoo, you define:
- **Raw Materials/Components**: What ingredients/materials you need
- **Quantities**: How much of each component is required
- **Output**: How many units the BOM produces
- **Unit Cost**: Automatically calculated by the system

### 2. **Real Example (Like Your Request)**
**Scenario**: Create Product ABC using:
- 20 KG of Product A
- 20 g of Product B  
- 1 L of Product C
- **Output**: 110 units of Product ABC

**System Calculations**:
- Total component cost = (20 × cost_of_A) + (0.02 × cost_of_B) + (1 × cost_of_C)
- Unit cost = Total component cost ÷ 110 units
- Final product cost automatically updated in inventory

### 3. **Real-Time Production Capacity**
The system shows:
- **How many BOMs can be produced** with current stock
- **Total units possible** (BOMs × output quantity)
- **Stock status** for each component (low stock warnings)
- **Cost breakdown** with visual indicators

### 4. **Automatic Cost Calculation**
- **Component costs** are fetched from inventory prices
- **Unit cost** is calculated: Total Cost ÷ Output Quantity
- **Final product cost** is automatically updated
- **Real-time updates** when component quantities change

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema Updates
```sql
-- Added to BillOfMaterials table
outputQuantity  Float    -- How many units this BOM produces
outputUnit      String   -- Unit of measurement (pieces, kg, etc.)
unitCost        Float?   -- Auto-calculated cost per unit
```

### API Enhancements
- **POST /api/production/bom**: Creates BOM with cost calculation
- **Automatic inventory updates**: Final product cost updated
- **Validation**: Ensures all components exist and have valid quantities

### Frontend Features
- **Magic UI components** for better UX
- **Real-time calculations** as you type
- **Production capacity analysis**
- **Stock level warnings**
- **Multi-language support** (English/French)

## Usage Example

### Creating a BOM:
1. **BOM Name**: "BOM for Product ABC"
2. **Final Product**: Select "Product ABC" 
3. **Output**: 110 pieces
4. **Components**:
   - Product A: 20 KG
   - Product B: 20 g (0.02 KG)
   - Product C: 1 L

### System Response:
- ✅ **Total Component Cost**: $X.XX
- ✅ **Cost per Unit**: $X.XXXX
- ✅ **Can Produce**: Y BOMs (Y×110 = Z units)
- ✅ **Stock Warnings**: Shows which materials are running low

### Result:
- Product ABC cost automatically updated to calculated unit cost
- BOM stored for future production orders
- Inventory tracking ready for production

## Benefits

### 1. **Exact Odoo Functionality**
- Same workflow as Odoo manufacturing
- Automatic cost calculations
- Real-time capacity planning

### 2. **Better Decision Making**
- Know exactly how much you can produce
- See unit costs before committing
- Track material usage efficiently

### 3. **Inventory Integration**
- Automatic product cost updates
- Stock level monitoring
- Production planning based on availability

### 4. **User-Friendly Interface**
- Visual cost breakdowns
- Real-time calculations
- Clear stock status indicators

## Next Steps
1. **Test the BOM creation** with real products
2. **Verify cost calculations** match expectations
3. **Create production orders** using the BOMs
4. **Monitor inventory** impacts

The system now provides the exact Odoo-like experience you requested, with automatic cost calculation and production capacity analysis!
