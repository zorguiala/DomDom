## How to Create Products During Purchase Orders

When creating a purchase order, you can add new products on-the-fly without leaving the page:

### Method 1: Using the Dropdown
1. **Start a new purchase order** by selecting a supplier
2. **Click "Add Item"** to add a line item
3. **Click in the Product field** - a dropdown will appear
4. **Type the name of a new product** that doesn't exist yet
5. **Look for the blue "+ Add new product" option** at the bottom of the dropdown
6. **Click on it** to open the product creation modal

### Method 2: Using the Quick Add Button
1. **Type a product name** in the product field
2. **Look for the blue "+" button** that appears on the right side of the input field
3. **Click the "+" button** to instantly create a new product

### Product Creation Modal
When the modal opens:
- **Name**: Pre-filled with what you typed
- **Unit**: Enter the unit of measurement (kg, pcs, box, etc.)
- **Product Type**: Automatically set to "Raw Material" for purchase orders
- **Click "Create Product"** to save

The new product will:
- Be automatically added to your purchase order line item
- Be created as a Raw Material (suitable for purchasing)
- Be available for future use in your inventory
- Have pricing that can be updated later in inventory management

### Tips for Success
- ‚úÖ **Type the full product name** you want to create
- ‚úÖ **Look for the blue text "Add new product"** in the dropdown
- ‚úÖ **Use the "+" button** for quick access
- ‚úÖ **Make sure to fill in the Unit field** (required)
- ‚ùå Don't select an existing product if you want to create a new one

### Troubleshooting
If you don't see the "Add new product" option:
1. Make sure you've typed a product name that doesn't already exist
2. Check that the dropdown is open (click in the field)
3. Look for the blue "+" button on the right side of the input
4. Ensure you're not selecting an existing product from the list
