Coding standards, domain knowledge, and preferences that AI should follow.

- Use consistent naming conventions (e.g., camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for classes).
- Write clear and concise comments to explain complex logic.
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles to reduce code duplication.
- Use TypeScript features like interfaces and types for better type safety.
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task.
- Write unit tests for all new features and bug fixes.
- Use async/await for asynchronous code to improve readability.
- Handle errors gracefully and provide helpful error messages.
- Keep dependencies up to date and remove unused ones.
- Follow the project's folder structure and organization conventions.
- Use descriptive commit messages that explain the changes made.
- Ensure code is well-documented, including public APIs and complex algorithms.
- Use ESLint and Prettier for code linting and formatting.
- Optimize performance where necessary, but prioritize readability and maintainability.
- Use version control best practices, including branching strategies and pull request reviews.
- Follow security best practices, such as input validation and sanitization.
- Use environment variables for configuration settings.
- Ensure accessibility standards are met in UI components.
- Use semantic HTML and ARIA roles for better accessibility.
- Write responsive designs that work well on various screen sizes.
- Use feature flags for new features to allow gradual rollouts.
- Document APIs using OpenAPI or similar standards.
- Use Magic UI MCP Server for UI components and design consistency.
- Ensure that all code is compatible with the latest stable version of TypeScript.
- File names should be descriptive and match the primary export of the file.
- Use consistent indentation and spacing throughout the codebase.
- Code should be modular and reusable, promoting component-based architecture.
- Code complexity should be minimized by breaking down large components into smaller, manageable pieces.
- Use descriptive variable names that convey their purpose.
- Use md files for documentation, including README files for each module or feature.
- Currently using powershell of windows, so please ensure compatibility with it.
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflows, ensuring that all tests pass before merging code.
