# Inventory to Stock Module Refactoring Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for refactoring the current Inventory module into a more streamlined Stock module. The plan follows the requirements specified in TASKS.md and STOCK_MODULE_PLAN.md.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Backend Refactoring

#### 1. Entity Refactoring

- **Rename and refactor entities**:

  - Rename `InventoryTransaction` to `StockTransaction`
  - Rename `InventoryCount` to `StockCount`
  - Rename `InventoryBatch` to `StockBatch` (if needed)
  - Update all related entity references

- **Simplify transaction types**:

  - Consolidate transaction types to: PURCHASE, PRODUCTION_IN, PRODUCTION_OUT, SALE, ADJUSTMENT
  - Add reference field for linking to related entities

- **Enhance Product entity**:
  - Add profitability metrics calculation fields
  - Ensure cost tracking fields are properly implemented

#### 2. Service Layer Refactoring

- **Create StockService**:

  - Implement stock tracking for raw materials and finished products
  - Create methods for calculating stock valuation
  - Add methods for identifying most profitable items
  - Develop functionality for tracking top-selling items
  - Optimize low stock detection and alerting

- **Refactor TransactionService**:

  - Simplify transaction recording workflow
  - Create aggregation methods for reporting
  - Implement stock movement analysis

- **Refactor CountService**:
  - Streamline inventory verification process
  - Implement improved reconciliation workflow

#### 3. Controller Layer Refactoring

- **Create StockController**:

  - Implement endpoints for basic stock CRUD operations
  - Add endpoints for stock metrics (value, profitability, sales)
  - Create endpoints for low stock alerts

- **Refactor TransactionController**:

  - Simplify transaction endpoints
  - Add bulk transaction capability

- **Refactor CountController**:
  - Streamline count process endpoints
  - Simplify reconciliation endpoints

#### 4. Database Migrations

- Create migration script for:
  - Renaming inventory tables to stock tables
  - Adding new fields for metrics
  - Updating foreign key relationships
  - Preserving existing data

### Phase 2: Frontend Refactoring

#### 1. Component Development

- **Create Stock Dashboard**:

  - Implement overview metrics (Stock Value, Low Stock, Profitability, Top Sellers)
  - Create metrics widgets with drill-down capability

- **Develop StockList Component**:

  - Create filterable, sortable list of all stock items
  - Add quick access to stock transactions
  - Include visual indicators for stock status

- **Implement StockTransactionForm**:

  - Create simplified form for recording stock movements
  - Support different transaction types in a unified interface

- **Create StockValuationReport**:

  - Implement financial view of inventory
  - Add historical valuation tracking
  - Include export functionality

- **Develop StockCount Workflow**:
  - Simplify count creation, execution, and reconciliation
  - Improve user interface for count process

#### 2. Custom Hooks Development

- **Create useStock hook**:

  - Implement core stock data fetching and state management

- **Create useStockMetrics hook**:

  - Implement calculations for stock metrics

- **Create useStockTransactions hook**:

  - Implement management of stock movement operations

- **Create useStockCount hook**:
  - Implement management of inventory count workflow

#### 3. Routing and Navigation Updates

- Update main navigation to replace "Inventory" with "Stock"
- Create routes for new stock components
- Implement sub-navigation within Stock module

### Phase 3: Integration and Testing

#### 1. Integration

- Connect frontend components to refactored backend endpoints
- Test complete stock management workflow
- Validate metrics calculations
- Test BOM creation and management within Stock module

#### 2. Testing

- Write unit tests for StockService core functions
- Create integration tests for database interactions
- Implement UI tests for component rendering and functionality
- Test end-to-end workflows

### Phase 4: Documentation

- Update PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md to reflect new Stock module structure
- Create technical documentation for Stock API endpoints
- Document stock data flow and business logic
- Create data model diagrams for the refactored entities

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Week 1**: Backend entity and service refactoring
2. **Week 2**: Backend controller refactoring and database migrations
3. **Week 3**: Frontend component development
4. **Week 4**: Custom hooks development and routing updates
5. **Week 5**: Integration, testing, and documentation

## Success Criteria

- All inventory functionality successfully migrated to Stock module
- New metrics and reporting capabilities implemented
- Simplified user interface for stock management
- All tests passing
- Documentation updated

## Risks and Mitigation

- **Data loss during migration**: Implement thorough backup and rollback procedures
- **Functionality regression**: Ensure comprehensive test coverage
- **Performance issues**: Optimize database queries and implement caching
- **User adoption**: Provide training and documentation for new interface

## Next Steps

1. Review this implementation plan with stakeholders
2. Set up development environment for refactoring
3. Begin implementation of Phase 1
