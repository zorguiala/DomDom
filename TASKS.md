# üìã DomDom Project Tasks

This document tracks current tasks, priorities, and progress for the DomDom project.

## üîÑ Currently In Progress

### Important - Codebase Refactoring

- [x] Read rules and coding style and plan refactoring approach
- [ ] Frontend Component Refactoring:
  - [ ] Resolve component duplication:
    - [ ] Compare implementations and determine which to keep
    - [ ] Consolidate to a single implementation in the appropriate location
    - [ ] Update all imports to reference the correct component files
  - [ ] Fix file naming conventions:
    - [ ] Create a script to rename frontend component files from PascalCase to kebab-case
    - [ ] Update all import statements across the project accordingly
    - [ ] Test that the application builds successfully after renaming
  - [ ] Reorganize file structure:
    - [ ] Move layout components to components/layout directory
    - [ ] Ensure all feature-specific components are in appropriate feature folders
    - [ ] Group related components by functionality
    - [ ] Update imports after reorganization
  - [ ] Enhance component structure:
    - [ ] Extract business logic from UI components into custom hooks
    - [ ] Update components to use the extracted hooks
    - [ ] Add proper type definitions and prop validations
    - [ ] Ensure components follow the functional component pattern
- [ ] Backend Code Refactoring:
  - [ ] Review and refactor files exceeding 500 lines
  - [ ] Ensure consistent module structure across features
  - [ ] Verify proper separation of concerns (thin controllers, business logic in services)
